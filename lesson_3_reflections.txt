When would you want to create a remote reposity rather than keeping all your work local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up to date with your remote repository ?

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branch is for getting a separate copy of the main copy and mainly is done locally.
Clone is to make a copy of a repository either locally or remotely.
Fork is very similar to clone though it's done on GitHub.
